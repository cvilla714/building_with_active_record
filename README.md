# Building With Active Records

> This project is about active records,models, and associations to the tests. This application similar to Reddit (called Micro-Reddit) where a user can create a post and add comments to it.For each scenario, we are asked to write down the data, associations, and validations necessary to build it. That means which models (data tables) will be necessary to store the data (and which columns you will need), which fields of those tables will be subject to validation (e.g. minimum password length or username uniqueness).
